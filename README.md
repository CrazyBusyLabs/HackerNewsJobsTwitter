# HackerNews Jobs Twitter Integration

---

A simple Firebase listener to get the new job post from HackerNews and to publish them on the @hackernewsjobds channel on Twitter.

This project was started as a learning experience for me to get familiar with Angular.js, and I welcome anyone else in the web development community to play with it :)

## Installation

Set the environemnt variables defining your mySQL server information:

| Environment Variable |
| ---| --- |
| TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY |
| TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET |
| TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY |
| DATABASE_USER |
| TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET |

Run `npm start` or `node .` for a dev server.
