# HackerNews Jobs Twitter Integration

A simple Firebase listener gets the new job posts from HackerNews and then publishes them on the [@hackernewsjobs](https://twitter.com/hackernewsjobs) channel on Twitter.

This project was started as a learning experience and I welcome anyone else in the web development community to play with it :)
